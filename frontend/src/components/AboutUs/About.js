              A developer with the passion for developing a scalable

              and expand my knowledge and skills towards working in a

              Something that I love about software development is the
              opportunity to work with people from a wide range of disciplines.
              The software development lifecycle involves working with so many
              different people and departments and, as a people person and
              someone who loves to build new relationships, itâ€™s great to be
              able to come together with other professionals who are striving
              towards the same goal.
